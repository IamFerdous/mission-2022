                <p>Successful people maintain a positive focus in life no matter what is going on around them. They stay focused on their past successes rather than their past failures, and on the next action steps they need to take to get them closer to the fulfillment of their goals rather than all the other distractions that life presents to them.</p>

                <p>My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. Stay focused on your mission, remain steadfast in your pursuit of excellence, and always do the right thing.</p>

                <h4>Vission</h4>
                <p>Work hard for what you want because it won't come to you without a fight. You have to be strong and courageous and know that you can do anything you put your mind to. If somebody puts you down or criticizes you, just keep on believing in yourself and turn it into something positive.</p>

                <p>You are capable of more than you know. Choose a goal that seems right for you and strive to be the best, however hard the path. Aim high. Behave honorably. Prepare to be alone at times, and to endure failure. Persist! The world needs all you can give.</p>
